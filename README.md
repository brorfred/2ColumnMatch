2ColumnMatch
============

This project is supposed to serve as an example for using HandsOnTable with Python + Flask + Jinja2. It's also an useful tool which allows an user to match the rows of one column to the rows of another column.

This was specifically created to be deployed on Google App Engine.

Based on flask-appengine-template: https://github.com/kamalgill/flask-appengine-template
