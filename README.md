2ColumnMatch
============

This project is supposed to serve as an example for using HandsOnTable with Python + Flask + Jinja2. It's also an useful tool which allows an user to match the rows of one column to the rows of a another column.

Based on flask-appengine-template: https://github.com/kamalgill/flask-appengine-template
